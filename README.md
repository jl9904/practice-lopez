## FLO
FLO is an excellent British girl group/band that incorporates R&B throughout a new age sound that truly seperates them from other rising groups. They have **gorgeous** hits like "Soft", "Losing You", and "Shoulda Woulda Coulda", all resonating with me very well. They started off with their debut single "Cardboard Box" and it was **fantastic** for not only listeners but for their trajectory in the music industry.
